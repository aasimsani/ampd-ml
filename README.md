# AMPD Machine Learning
### Work in progress
This is a project where I've used the [Artificial Manga Panel Dataset](https://github.com/aasimsani/artificial_manga_panel_dataset) to create a speech bubble
detector for manga panels in order to allow the manga to be translated more cleanly and faster by either Google APIs or even actual translators.

## Current progress
- [x] Create a dataset from the Artifical Manga Panel Dataset repo
- [x] Run a benchmark via FasterRCNN to see how well it works out of the box
- [] Create or obtain a test set of real manga panels to further diagnose the model
- [] Modify and iterate
